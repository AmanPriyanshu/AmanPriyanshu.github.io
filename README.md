# 👋 Hey, I'm Aman!

Welcome to the repo of my little corner of the internet! Check it out live at [amanpriyanshu.github.io](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io)

## 🤔 What's This All About?

This is where I share my adventures in AI security and privacy research. Think of it as my digital playground where I get to show off cool stuff like:
- 📚 My published research (yes, somehow they were published!)
- 📰 Times when my work made it to the news (mostly for breaking things in AI, oops)
- ✍️ Blog posts about my tech experiments
- 🎮 Interactive demos that make privacy concepts fun
- 🏆 Some humble brags about achievements

## 🎨 Cool Features

Built this with some neat tricks:
- 🔄 A bio that switches between "Hi I'm Aman" and "Aman is a researcher who..." (because why not?)
- 🎛️ An epsilon control that lets you mess with text privacy (try it, it's fun!)
- 🎮 Some games I made to explain complex privacy concepts
- 📱 Works on your phone too (because coding on the bus is a thing)

## 📬 Wanna Chat?

I'm always up for interesting conversations about AI, privacy, or why differential privacy is actually cool:
